# Django GCloud Connectors

The aim of this project is to create Django database connectors for Google Cloud. Currently
it contains a connector for the Google Cloud Datastore (Firestore in Datastore mode) but in future
it may also house a Firestore connector, or even a MemoryStore one.

This is the continuation of the Datastore connector from the [Djangae project](https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae)
but converted to use the Cloud Datastore API on Python 3.
